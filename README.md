# House_Price_Prediction
We review the regression and classification  models to predict the price of houses based on a set of  factors. Inspired by the Linear Regression model, we aim  to train and test using a housing dataset and compare the  results with the KNN Classification model. Other than  presenting the predicted values, we assess the average  accuracy of the models by comparing the actual prices.
